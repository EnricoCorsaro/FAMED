Overview
========
In this section we provide an overview of the outputs produced by the FAMED pipeline from the GLOBAL and CHUNK modules.
The figure below shows a sketch of the output folders produced by FAMED. In this section we briefly outline the main and most important outputs produced by the pipeline, namely the figures stored under the folder ``figs``, and the ASCII summary files stored under the folder ``summary``. 

The outputs produced by the pipeline are divided into sub-categories. The figure below shows an outline of this scheme.
